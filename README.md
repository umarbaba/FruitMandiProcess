# FruitMandiProcess
# Introduction:
The fruit mandi in our local area currently operates through a manual system, which involves agents who act as intermediaries between the growers and buyers. These agents take a 12% commission and provide advances to the growers, who then repay them with boxes of apples. This system is inefficient, prone to errors, and lacks transparency. Therefore, the goal of this project is to develop an online application that will automate the process and provide a more efficient and transparent system for all stakeholders.

# Problem Statement and Objective:
The current manual system at the fruit mandi is plagued with several problems. The process is inefficient and prone to errors due to manual record-keeping, lack of real-time information, and dependence on intermediaries. Additionally, there is no transparency in the system, and growers often receive less than the actual value of their produce due to the commission charged by agents. Therefore, the objective of this project is to develop an online application that will solve these problems by providing a transparent, efficient, and user-friendly platform for all stakeholders, while still allowing agents to take their commission.

# Scope:
The proposed project will develop an online application that will facilitate the buying and selling of apples in the fruit mandi. The application will allow growers to register and create a profile where they can list their apple gardens and provide information about their produce. The application will also allow buyers to register and create a profile where they can view and purchase apples from the growers. The application will include features such as real-time inventory tracking, automatic price calculation, online payment, and dispute resolution. The scope of the project will include developing a user-friendly interface for both growers, buyers, and agents to manage their sales, inventory and transaction, as well as a back-end system for managing the database and transactions. The agent will use the application to facilitate the process instead of manual methods.
